## 课程简介

This course is a self-contained concise review of general thermodynamics concepts, multicomponent equilibrium properties, chemical equilibrium, electrochemical potentials, and chemical kinetics, as needed to introduce the methods of nonequilibrium thermodynamics and to provide a unified understanding of phase equilibria, transport, and nonequilibrium phenomena useful for future energy and climate engineering technologies. Applications include second-law efficiencies and methods to allocate primary energy consumptions and CO2 emissions in cogeneration and hybrid power systems, minimum work of separation, maximum work of mixing, osmotic pressure and membrane equilibria, metastable states, spinodal decomposition, Onsager’s near-equilibrium reciprocity in thermodiffusive, thermoelectric, and electrokinetic cross effects.
